# Calling a Web API in a daemon app or long-running process

![Build badge](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/a7934fdd-dcde-4492-a406-7fad6ac00e17/<BuildNumber>/badge)

## About this sample

### Overview

This sample demonstrates a Desktop application calling a ASP.NET Web API that is secured using Azure Active Directory.

1. The .Net client Desktop application uses the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) to obtain a JWT access token from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authenticate the user when calling the ASP.NET Web API.

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vsdownload)
- An Internet connection
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-daemon.git`
```

or download and exact the repository .zip file.

> Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet packages, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

### Step 2:  Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are two projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- either follow the steps [Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant](#step-2-register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant) and [Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant](#choose-the-azure-ad-tenant-where-you-want-to-create-your-applications)
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you
  - modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files.

If you want to use this automation, read the instructions in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account gives you access to more than one tenant, select your account in the top right corner, and set your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant
   (using **Switch Directory**).
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.

#### Register the service app (TodoListService)

1. In **App registrations (Preview)** page, select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `TodoListService`.
   - In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)**.
   - In the Redirect URI (optional) section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URIs.
       - `https://localhost:44321/`
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select on **Expose an API**
   - Select **Add a scope**
   - accept the proposed Application ID URI (api://{clientId}) by selecting **Save and Continue**
   - Enter the following parameters
     - for **Scope name** use `access_as_user`
     - Keep **Admins and users** for **Who can consent**
     - in **Admin consent display name** type `Access TodoListService as a user`
     - in **Admin consent description** type `Accesses the TodoListService Web API as a user`
     - in **User consent display name** type `Access TodoListService as a user`
     - in **User consent description** type `Accesses the TodoListService Web API as a user`
     - Keep **State** as **Enabled**
     - Select **Add scope**

#### Register the client app (TodoListDaemon)

1. In **App registrations (Preview)** page, select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `TodoListDaemon`.
   - In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)**.
   - In the Redirect URI (optional) section, select **Web** in the combo-box.
      > Even if this is a desktop application, this is a confidential client application hence the *Application Type* being 'Web', which might seem counter intuitive.
   - For the Redirect URI*, enter `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListDaemon`, replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your Azure AD tenant.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. From the **Certificates & secrets** page, in the **Client secrets** section, choose **New client secret**:

   - Type a key description (of instance `app secret`),
   - Select a key duration of either **In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**.
   - When you press the **Add** button, the key value will be displayed, copy, and save the value in a safe location.
   - You'll need this key later to configure the project in Visual Studio. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means,
     so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **API permissions**
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected
   - In the list of APIs, select the API `TodoListService`.
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **Access 'TodoListService'**. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button

1. At this stage permissions are assigned correctly but the client app does not allow interaction. 
   Therefore no consent can be presented via a UI and accepted to use the service app. 
   Click the **Grant/revoke admin consent for {tenant}** button, and then select **Yes** when you are asked if you want to grant consent for the
   requested permissions for all account in the tenant.
   You need to be an Azure AD tenant admin to do this.

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the solution in Visual Studio to configure the projects

#### Configure the service project

> Note: if you used the setup scripts, the changes below will have been applied for you

1. Open the `TodoListService\Web.Config` file
1. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ida:Audience` and replace the existing value with the App ID URI you registered earlier for the TodoListService app. For instance use `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`, where `<your_tenant_name>` is the name of your Azure AD tenant.

#### Configure the client project

> Note: if you used the setup scripts, the changes below will have been applied for you

1. Open the `TodoListDaemon\App.Config` file
1. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ida:ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `TodoListDaemon` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `ida:AppKey` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `TodoListDaemon` app, in the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `todo:TodoListResourceId` and replace the existing value with the App ID URI you registered earlier for the TodoListService app. For instance use `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`, where `<your_tenant_name>` is the name of your Azure AD tenant.
1. Find the app key `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` and replace the existing value with the base address of the TodoListService project (by default `https://localhost:44321/`).

### Step 4: Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.  You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

## How to deploy this sample to Azure

This project has one WebApp / Web API projects. To deploy them to Azure Web Sites, you'll need, for each one, to:

- create an Azure Web Site
- publish the Web App / Web APIs to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.

### Create and publish the `TodoListService` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Click **Create a resource** in the top left-hand corner, select **Web + Mobile** --> **Web App**, select the hosting plan and region, and give your web site a name, for example, `TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.  Click Create Web Site.

## Review and delete the following two lines if not applicable ##
1. Choose **SQL Database**, click on "Create a new database", enter `DefaultConnection` as the **DB Connection String Name**.
1. Select or create a database server, and enter server login credentials.

1. Once the web site is created, click on it to manage it.  For this set of steps, download the publish profile by clicking **Get publish profile** and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from source control, can also be used.
1. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the TodoListService project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
1. Click on **Settings** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is https, for example [https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click Next.
1. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
1. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Update the Active Directory tenant application registration for `TodoListService`

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. On the top bar, click on your account and under the **Directory** list, choose the Active Directory tenant containing the `TodoListService` application.
1. On the applications tab, select the `TodoListService` application.
1. From the *Settings -> Properties* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URL in the list of values of the *Settings -> Reply URLs* menu

### Update the `TodoListDaemon` to call the `TodoListService` Running in Azure Web Sites

1. In Visual Studio, go to the `TodoListDaemon` project.
2. Open `TodoListDaemon\App.Config`.  Only one change is needed - update the `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` key value to be the address of the website you published,
   for example, [https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net).
3. Run the client! If you are trying multiple different client types (for example, .Net, Windows Store, Android, iOS) you can have them all call this one published web API.

> NOTE: Remember, the To Do list is stored in memory in this TodoListService sample. Azure Web Sites will spin down your web site if it is inactive, and your To Do list will get emptied.
Also, if you increase the instance count of the web site, requests will be distributed among the instances. To Do will, therefore, not be the same on each instance.
