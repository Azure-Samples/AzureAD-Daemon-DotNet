## About this sample

### Overview

This sample demonstrates a Desktop daemon application calling a ASP.NET Web API that is secured using Azure Active Directory. This scenario is useful for situations where a headless, or unattended job, or process, needs to run as an application identity, instead of as a user's identity.

1. The .Net `TodoListDaemon` application uses the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) to obtain a JWT access token from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The token is requested using the OAuth 2.0 [Client Credentials flow](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Client-credential-flows), where the client credential is a password. You could also use a certificate to prove the identity of the app. Client credential with certificate is the object of another sample: [active-directory-dotnet-daemon-certificate-credential](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-daemon-certificate-credential) sample.
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authenticate the user when calling the `TodoListService` ASP.NET Web API.

### Scenario

Once the service started, when you start the `TodoListDaemon` desktop application, it repeatedly:

- adds items to the todo list maintained by the service
- lists the existing items.

No user interaction is involved.

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vsdownload)
- An Internet connection
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account that is an **global admin of your Azure AD tenant**. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account (formerly Windows Live account). Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-daemon.git`

> Given that the name of the sample is pretty long, and so are the name of the referenced NuGet pacakges, you might want to clone it in a folder close to the root of your hard drive, to avoid file size limitations on Windows.

### Step 2:  Register the sample application with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are two projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- either follow the steps [Step 2: Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant](#step-2-register-the-sample-with-your-azure-active-directory-tenant) and [Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant](#choose-the-azure-ad-tenant-where-you-want-to-create-your-applications)
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you
  - modify the Visual Studio projects' configuration files.

If you want to use this automation, read the instructions in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account gives you access to more than one tenant, select your account in the top right corner, and set your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant
   (using **Switch Directory**).
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations (Preview)**.

#### Register the service app (todoListService_web_daemon_v1)

1. In **App registrations** page, select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `todoListService_web_daemon_v1`.
   - In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only ({tenant name})**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select on **Expose an API**
   - For **Application ID URI**, set it to  `https://<your_tenant_name>/todoListService_web_daemon_v1` and pres **Save**

#### Step 2: Secure your Web API by defining Application Roles (permission)

If you don't do anything more, Azure AD will provide a token for any daemon application (using the client credential flow) requesting an access token for your Web API (for its App ID URI)
In this step we are going to ensure that Azure AD only provides a token to the applications to which the Tenant admin grants consent. We are going to limit the access to our TodoList client by defining authorizations

##### Add an app role to the manifest

1. While still in the blade for your  application, click **Manifest**.
1. Edit the manifest by locating the `appRoles` setting and adding an application roles. The role definition is provided in the JSON block below.  Leave the `allowedMemberTypes` to "Application" only.
1. Save the manifest.

The content of `appRoles` should be the following (the `id` can be any unique GUID)

```JSon
"appRoles": [
	{
	"allowedMemberTypes": [ "Application" ],
	"description": "Accesses the todoListService_web_daemon_v1 as an application.",
	"displayName": "access_as_application",
	"id": "ccf784a6-fd0c-45f2-9c08-2f9d162a0628",
	"isEnabled": true,
	"lang": null,
	"origin": "Application",
	"value": "access_as_application"
	}
],
```

##### Ensure that tokens Azure AD issues tokens for your Web API only to allowed clients

The Web API tests for the app role (that's the developer way of doing it). But you can even ask Azure Active Directory to issue a token for your Web API only to applications which were approved by the tenant admin. For this:

1. On the app **Overview** page for your app registration, select the hyperlink with the name of your application in **Managed application in local directory** (note this field title can be truncated for instance Managed application in ...)

   > When you select this link you will navigate to the **Enterprise Application Overview** page associated with the service principal for your application in the tenant where you created it. You can navigate back to the app registration page by using the back button of your browser.

1. Select the **Properties** page in the **Manage** section of the Enterprise application pages
1. If you want AAD to enforce access to your Web API from only certain clients, set **User assignment required?** to **Yes**.

   > **Important security tip**
   >
   > By setting **User assignment required?** to **Yes**, AAD will check the app role assignments of the clients when they request an access token for the Web API (see app permissions below). If the client was not be assigned to any AppRoles, AAD would just return `invalid_client: AADSTS501051: Application xxxx is not assigned to a role for the xxxx`
   >
   > If you keep **User assignment required?** to **No**, <span style='background-color:yellow; display:inline'>Azure AD  wonâ€™t check the app role assignments  when a client requests an access token to your Web API</span>. Therefore, any daemon client (that is any client using client credentials flow) would still be able to obtain the access token for the  Web API just by specifying its audience. Any application, would be able to access the API without having to request permissions for it. Now this is not then end of it, as your Web API can always, as is done in this sample, verify that the application has the right role (which was authorized by the tenant admin), by validating that the access token has a roles claim, and 

1. Select **Save**

#### Register the client app (todoList_web_daemon_v1)

1. In **App registrations** page, select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `todoList_web_daemon_v1`.
   - In the **Supported account types** section, **Accounts in this organizational directory only ({tenant name})**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. From the **Certificates & secrets** page, in the **Client secrets** section, choose **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (of instance `app secret`),
   - Select a key duration of either **In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**.
   - When you press the **Add** button, the key value will be displayed, copy, and save the value in a safe location.
   - You'll need this key later to configure the project in Visual Studio. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means,
     so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.
1. In the list of pages for the app, select **API permissions**
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected
   - In the list of APIs, select the API `todoListService_web_daemon_v1`
     - In the **Application Permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **access_as_application'**. Use the search box if necessary.
     - Select the **Add permissions** button
1. You can remove the default permission **User.Read** as our client is a daemon app. there is no user.

1. At this stage permissions are assigned correctly. However, by definition, daemon applications does not allow interaction. Therefore no consent can be presented via a UI and accepted to use the service app. The tenant admin need to consent for the client to access your application. for this Click the **Grant/revoke admin consent for {tenant}** button, and then select **Yes** when you are asked if you want to grant consent for the
   requested permissions for all account in the tenant.
   You need to be an Azure AD tenant admin to do this.

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the solution in Visual Studio to configure the projects

#### Configure the service project

> Note: if you used the setup scripts, the changes below will have been applied for you

1. Open the `TodoListService\Web.Config` file
1. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ida:Audience` and replace the existing value with the App ID URI you registered earlier for the todoListService_web_daemon_v1 app. For instance use `https://<your_tenant_name>/todoListService_web_daemon_v1`, where `<your_tenant_name>` is the name of your Azure AD tenant.

#### Configure the client project

> Note: if you used the setup scripts, the changes below will have been applied for you

1. Open the `TodoListDaemon\App.Config` file
1. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the app key `ida:ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `todoList_web_daemon_v1` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `ida:AppKey` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of the `todoList_web_daemon_v1` app, in the Azure portal.
1. Find the app key `todo:TodoListResourceId` and replace the existing value with the App ID URI you registered earlier for the todoListService_web_daemon_v1 app. For instance use `https://<your_tenant_name>/todoListService_web_daemon_v1`, where `<your_tenant_name>` is the name of your Azure AD tenant.
1. Find the app key `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` and replace the existing value with the base address of the todoListService_web_daemon_v1 project (by default `https://localhost:44321/`).

**NOTE:** The TodoListService's `ida:Audience` and TodoListDaemon's `todo:TodoListResourceId` app key values must not only match the App ID URI you configured, but they must also match each other exactly. This mach includes casing. Otherwise calls to the TodoListService /api/todolist endpoint will fail with "Error: unauthorized".

### Step 4: Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.  You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

See the scenario section above to understand how to run the sample

## How to deploy this sample to Azure

This project has one WebApp / Web API projects. To deploy them to Azure Web Sites, you'll need, for each one, to:

- create an Azure Web Site
- publish the Web App / Web APIs to the web site, and
- update its client(s) to call the web site instead of IIS Express.

### Create and Publish the `TodoListService` to an Azure Web Site

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **Create a resource** in the top left-hand corner, select **Web + Mobile** --> **Web App**, select the hosting plan and region, and give your web site a name, for example, `TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net`.  Click Create Web Site.
3. Once the web site is created, click on it to manage it.  For this set of steps, download the publish profile by clicking **Get publish profile** and save it.  Other deployment mechanisms, such as from source control, can also be used.
4. Switch to Visual Studio and go to the TodoListService project.  Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Publish**.  Click **Import Profile** on the bottom bar, and import the publish profile that you downloaded earlier.
5. Click on **Settings** and in the `Connection tab`, update the Destination URL so that it is https, for example [https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Click Next.
6. On the Settings tab, make sure `Enable Organizational Authentication` is NOT selected.  Click **Save**. Click on **Publish** on the main screen.
7. Visual Studio will publish the project and automatically open a browser to the URL of the project.  If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Update the Active Directory tenant application registration for `TodoListService`

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. On the top bar, click on your account and under the **Directory** list, choose the Active Directory tenant containing the `TodoListService` application.
3. On the applications tab, select the `TodoListService` application.
4. From the Settings -> Reply URLs menu, update the Sign-On URL, and Reply URL fields to the address of your service, for example [https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net). Save the configuration.

### Update the `TodoListDaemon` to call the `TodoListService` Running in Azure Web Sites

1. In Visual Studio, go to the `TodoListDaemon` project.
2. Open `TodoListDaemon\App.Config`.  Only one change is needed - update the `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` key value to be the address of the website you published,
   for example, [https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net](https://TodoListService-contoso.azurewebsites.net).
3. Run the client! If you are trying multiple different client types (for example, .Net, Windows Store, Android, iOS) you can have them all call this one published web API.

> NOTE: Remember, the To Do list is stored in memory in this TodoListService sample. Azure Web Sites will spin down your web site if it is inactive, and your To Do list will get emptied.
Also, if you increase the instance count of the web site, requests will be distributed among the instances. To Do will, therefore, not be the same on each instance.

## About The Code

### Client side: the daemon app

The code acquiring a token is located entirely in the `TodoListDaemon\Program.cs` file.
The `Authentication` context is created (line 68)

```CSharp
authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority);
```

Then a `ClientCredential` is instantiated (line 69), from the TodoListDaemon application's Client ID and the application secret (`appKey`).

```CSharp
clientCredential = new ClientCredential(clientId, appKey);
```

This instance of `ClientCredential` is used in the `PostTodo()` and `GetTodo()` methods  as an argument to `AcquireTokenAsync` to get a token for the Web API (line 96 and 162)

```CSharp
result = await authContext.AcquireTokenAsync(todoListResourceId, clientCredential);
```

This token is then used as a bearer token to call the Web API (line 127 and 193)

```CSharp
httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.AccessToken)
```

### Service side: how the protected API

On the service side, the code directing ASP.NET to validate the access token is in `App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs`. It only validates the audience of the application (the App ID URI)

```CSharp
 public partial class Startup
 {
  // For more information on configuring authentication, please visit http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301864
  public void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)
  {
   app.UseWindowsAzureActiveDirectoryBearerAuthentication(
      new WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryBearerAuthenticationOptions
      {
       Tenant = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Tenant"],
       TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
       {
        ValidAudience = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Audience"]
       }
      });
   }
}
```

However, the controllers also validate that the client has a `roles` claim of value `access_as_application`. It returns an Unauthorized error otherwise.

```CSharp
 public IEnumerable<TodoItem> Get()
 {
  //
  // The roles claim tells what permissions the client application has in the service.
  // In this case we look for a roles value of access_as_application
  //
  Claim scopeClaim = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("roles");
  if (scopeClaim == null || (scopeClaim.Value != "access_as_application"))
  {
   throw new HttpResponseException(new HttpResponseMessage { StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized,
      ReasonPhrase = "The 'roles' claim does not contain 'access_as_application'or was not found" });
  }
  ...
 }
```

## How to recreate this sample

First, in Visual Studio create an empty solution to host the  projects.  Then, follow the following steps to create each project.

### Creating the TodoListService Project

1. In the solution, create a new ASP.Net MVC web API project called `TodoListService` and while creating the project:

   - Click the **Change Authentication** button,
   - Select **Organizational Accounts, Cloud - Single Organization**,
   - Enter the name of your Azure AD tenant,
   - and set the Access Level to **Single Sign On**. You will be prompted to sign in to your Azure AD tenant.

     > NOTE:  You must sign in with a user that is in the tenant; you cannot, during this step, sign in with a Microsoft account.

2. In the  folder, add a new class called `TodoItem.cs`.  Copy the implementation of TodoItem from this sample into the class.
3. Add a new, empty, Web API 2 controller called `TodoListController`.
4. Copy the implementation of the TodoListController from this sample into the controller.  Don't forget to add the `[Authorize]` attribute to the class.
5. In `TodoListController` resolving missing references by adding `using` statements for `System.Collections.Concurrent`, `TodoListService.Models`, `System.Security.Claims`.

### Creating the TodoListDaemon Project

1. In the solution, create a new Windows --> Console Application called TodoListDaemon.
2. Add the (stable) Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) NuGet, Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory, version 1.0.3 (or higher) to the project.
3. Add  assembly references to `System.Net.Http`, `System.Web.Extensions`, and `System.Configuration`.
4. Add a new class to the project called `TodoItem.cs`.  Copy the code from the sample project file of the same name into this class, completely replacing the code in the new file.
5. Copy the code from `Program.cs` in the sample project into the file of the same name in the new project, completely replacing the code in the new file.
6. In `app.config` create keys for `ida:AADInstance`, `ida:Tenant`, `ida:ClientId`, `ida:AppKey`, `todo:TodoListResourceId`, and `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` and set them accordingly.  For the global Azure cloud, the value of `ida:AADInstance` is `https://login.windows.net/{0}`.

Finally, in the properties of the solution itself, set both projects as startup projects.
